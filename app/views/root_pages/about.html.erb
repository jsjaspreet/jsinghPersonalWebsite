<p class="vollkron" id="aboutText">

  I've always loved building things. This past summer, I got to build an interesting data application
  as part of my software engineering internship with YP.
  From writing the first few lines of code of the application I worked on,
  to deploying multiple machines running the application to DigitalOcean's cloud, to writing a
  custom load balancer using Digital Ocean's API that would make scaling and administrating
  the application much easier, I found myself fascinated with all the different moving parts of a
  typical web application. What excites me the most is knowing that I only touched on a small part
  of what's possible, and I've continued building and exploring the software world ever since.
  In my spare time I enjoy attending hackathons, working out, and PWNing n00bs at Mario Kart 8.
